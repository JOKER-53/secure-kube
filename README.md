A CIS-aligned, zero-trust Kubernetes cluster provisioned via IaC — no manual security configuration required, 100% local, zero cloud cost.

## Container image

No local tool installation required — pull the image and run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  ghcr.io/joker-53/secure-kube:latest \
  make deploy
```

Or from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull joker-53/secure-kube:latest
```

The image bundles `terraform`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `kind`, and the `argocd` CLI at pinned versions. The Docker socket mount is required because `kind` creates cluster nodes as containers on your host Docker daemon.

## Problem statement

Default Kubernetes installations ship with zero network isolation, no pod security standards, and permissive RBAC. Teams adopt K8s fast and configure security slowly — or never. SecureKube eliminates that gap entirely at provisioning time: `make deploy` and the cluster is already hardened.

## Objectives

- CIS Kubernetes Benchmark controls enforced out of the box (see **Known limitations** for what's realistic on `kind`)
- Zero-trust networking via **default-deny NetworkPolicy** across all namespaces
- **Least-privilege RBAC** — no wildcard permissions, no cluster-admin for workloads
- **Pod security standards** — no root containers, no privileged pods, read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, no privileged ports
- **Audit logging** and runtime policy enforcement via OPA Gatekeeper (8 constraints) + Falco
- **One-command deployment** — `make deploy`, entirely on `kind` (local), no cloud account, no API keys, no billing

## Architecture

```
1. Provision cluster        kind CLI, driven by Terraform (static kind-config.yaml)
        |
        v
2. Network isolation        Calico CNI + default-deny NetworkPolicy
        |
        v
3. RBAC hardening            Least privilege, no wildcards
        |
        v
4. Policy enforcement        OPA Gatekeeper (8 constraints) + Pod Security Standards
        |
        v
5. Runtime monitoring        Falco (modern eBPF driver) + audit logging
        |
        v
6. CIS validation             kube-bench score reported
        |
        v
   Cluster ready -- secure by default
```

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Cluster provisioning | `kind` CLI, invoked from Terraform via `local-exec` |
| Package management | Helm (Gatekeeper, Falco) |
| Namespace policy | Kustomize |
| Local demo target | kind |
| CI validation | GitHub Actions |
| CIS scoring | kube-bench |

## GitOps with Argo CD

Every policy layer (NetworkPolicy, RBAC, Pod Security Standards, Gatekeeper constraints) is registered as an Argo CD `Application` pointing at this repo. Argo CD continuously watches for drift between git and the live cluster, and shows it in a UI — but **won't apply changes automatically** (manual sync mode). You approve each sync explicitly.

```
gitops/
└── apps/
    ├── project.yaml                  Argo CD AppProject (scoped source/destination allow-list)
    ├── network-policies-app.yaml     watches kustomize/base/network-policies/
    ├── rbac-app.yaml                 watches kustomize/base/rbac/
    ├── pod-security-app.yaml         watches kustomize/base/pod-security/
    ├── gatekeeper-templates-app.yaml watches gatekeeper/constraint-templates/
    └── gatekeeper-constraints-app.yaml watches gatekeeper/constraints/
```

Argo CD is installed as part of `make deploy`. Once up:

```bash
make dashboard-argocd   # open UI at localhost:8080 (prints admin password)
make sync-all           # trigger sync for every layer
make sync-policies      # trigger sync for network policies only
make sync-rbac          # RBAC only
make sync-gatekeeper    # Gatekeeper templates + constraints
make status             # shows Argo CD app health alongside everything else
```

**What GitOps gives you here:**
- Any manual `kubectl apply` someone does outside git gets flagged as drift in the UI
- Policy changes go through git → PR review → merge → manual sync approval, not ad-hoc shell commands
- Full audit trail of what changed, when, and why (git history)

Prerequisites: `terraform`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `kind`, `docker` (with your user in the `docker` group — see Troubleshooting if you hit permission errors).

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd securekube
make deploy
```

This runs, in order: `cluster` -> `policies` -> `gatekeeper` -> `falco` -> `test`.

Edit `config.env` to change the cluster name or toggle Calico/Falco before deploying.

### Useful commands

```bash
make status      # health of every component + active constraints + recent violations
make test        # negative tests (insecure pods rejected) + positive test (secure pod allowed)
make bench       # CIS Benchmark score via kube-bench
make dashboard   # port-forward Falco Sidekick UI to localhost:2802
make logs        # tail live Falco alerts
make clean-logs  # remove stale kube-bench/test job leftovers
make destroy     # tear down everything
```

### Try the example workloads yourself

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/secure-app.yaml       # should succeed
kubectl apply -f examples/insecure-apps.yaml    # every pod here should be rejected
```

## Known limitations (read this before treating it as "done")

- **`make bench` will not show a clean pass.** `kind` runs Kubernetes components as containers on your machine, not as a real multi-node control plane — controls around etcd file permissions, kubelet config file ownership, and certain node-level TLS settings can't be satisfied the way they would be on bare metal or a managed node group.
- **`anonymous-auth` is intentionally left enabled** on the API server, despite CIS 1.2.1 recommending it be disabled. Disabling it breaks `kubeadm join`'s bootstrap token discovery outright (a real, reproducible failure we hit and fixed — see `docs/architecture.md`). RBAC + NodeRestriction constrain what an unauthenticated request can actually do instead.
- **Gatekeeper's webhook is fail-open (`Ignore`), not fail-closed (`Fail`).** Fail-closed causes an unrecoverable deadlock with Calico's cluster-scoped IPAM CRDs on this stack (also a real failure we hit — full explanation in `docs/architecture.md`). This means there's a brief enforcement gap any time the webhook pod restarts.
- **The allowed-repos list ships permissive** (`docker.io/library/`, `ghcr.io/`, `gcr.io/`, `registry.k8s.io/`) so the bundled examples work out of the box. Tighten `gatekeeper/constraints/allowed-repos-constraint.yaml` to your actual registry before treating this as a real supply-chain control.
- **No GitOps for Helm releases (Gatekeeper, Falco, Argo CD itself).** Argo CD manages the policy layers (NetworkPolicy, RBAC, PSA, Gatekeeper constraints), but the Helm installs of Gatekeeper, Falco, and Argo CD are still handled imperatively by the Makefile. Adding these as Argo CD `Application` manifests (with `helm` source type) is the next step.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `permission denied ... docker.sock` | Your user isn't in the `docker` group, or the group change hasn't taken effect yet | `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, then fully log out and back in (not just `newgrp`) |
| `make cluster` / `kind create cluster` hangs or is slow | Normal on first run — pulling `kindest/node` image (~1GB+) | Let it run; check `docker images \| grep kindest` to confirm the pull is progressing |
| Worker nodes never join, `kubeadm join` retries forever | `anonymous-auth: false` breaks kubeadm's bootstrap token discovery | Already fixed in this repo's `kind-config.yaml` — don't re-add that flag |
| Gatekeeper pods stuck `ContainerCreating` forever, referencing its own webhook in events | Fail-closed webhook deadlocked against Calico's cluster-scoped IPAM CRDs | Already fixed via `validatingWebhookFailurePolicy: Ignore` in `helm/gatekeeper-values.yaml` |
| `helm install falco` fails with `driver.kind=ebpf ... no longer supported` | Falco chart renamed the value | Already fixed — `helm/falco-values.yaml` uses `modern_ebpf` |
| `kubectl apply` fails with `invalid object to validate` right after installing a new CRD | Stale local kubectl schema cache | `rm -rf ~/.kube/cache` and retry |
| `make test` — secure-app gets rejected on `seccompProfile` | Pod Security Standards' `restricted` profile requires `securityContext.seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` | Already set in `examples/secure-app.yaml` |
| `make bench` hangs, `kubectl wait` times out on `job/kube-bench` | `kube-bench` needs `hostPID`/`hostPath`, which our own restricted PSA on `default` blocks | Already fixed — `make bench` now runs it in `kube-system`, which is intentionally unlabeled for system tooling |
| Port 2802 already in use (`make dashboard`) | Another process is bound to it | `kubectl port-forward -n falco svc/falco-falcosidekick-ui <free-port>:2802` manually |
| `make destroy` leaves resources behind | Terraform state drift after manual `kubectl`/`kind` changes | `kind delete cluster --name securekube` as a manual fallback |
